        <h3>Benefits of drinking water</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Lubricates your joints</li>
          <p>
            Long-term dehydration can reduce the joints' shock-absorbing
            ability, leading to joint pain.
          </p>
          <li>Forms saliva and mucus</li>
          <p>
            Saliva and mucus help us digest our food, keep the mouth, nose and
            eyes moist, preventing friction and damage.
          </p>
          <li>Delivers oxygen throughout the body</li>
          <p>
            Blood is more than 90 percent water and carries oxygen to different
            parts of the body.
          </p>
          <li>Boosts skin health and beauty</li>
          <p>
            With dehydration, the skin can become more vulnerable to skin
            disorders and premature wrinkling.
          </p>
          <li>Cushions the brain, spinal cord and other sensitive tissues</li>
          <p>
            Dehydration can affect brain structure and function, along with the
            production of hormones and neurotransmitters, leading to problems
            with thinking and reasoning.
          </p>
          <li>Regulates body temperature</li>
          <p>
            Water that is stores in the middles layers of the skin comes to the
            surface as sweat when the body heats up, cooling the body as it
            evaporates.
          </p>
          <li>The digestive system depends on it</li>
          <p>
            Dehydration can lead to digestive problems, constipation and an
            overly acidic stomach, increasing the risk of heartburn and stomach
            ulcers.
          </p>
          <li>Flushes body waste</li>
          <p>
            Water is needed in the processes of sweating and remove of urine and
            feces.
          </p>
          <li>Helps maintain blood pressure</li>
          <p>
            Blood is about 90% water, so a lack of it can cause blood to become
            thicker, increasing blood pressure.
          </p>
          <li>Airways need it</li>
          <p>
            When dehydrated, airways are restricted by the body in an effort to
            minimize water loss, possibly leading to asthma and worsening
            allergies.
          </p>
          <li>Makes minerals and nutrients accessible</li>
          <p>
            Nutrients and minerals are dissolved in water, which makes it
            possible for them to reach different parts of the body.
          </p>
          <li>Prevents kidney damage</li>
          <p>
            Kidneys regulate fluids in the body. Insufficient water can lead to
            kidney stones and other problems.
          </p>
          <li>Boosts performance during exercise</li>
          <p>
            Consuming more water might enhance performance during strenous
            activity. Dehydration reduces performance in activities lasting
            longer than 30 minutes.
          </p>
          <li>Weight loss</li>
          <p>
            Water may help with weight loss if consumed instead of sweetened
            juices and sodas. Drinking water before meals can help prevent
            overeating by creating a sense of fullness.
          </p>
          <li>Reduces the chance of hangover</li>
          <p>
            Alternating water with alcoholic drinks can help prevent
            overconsumption of alcohol.

        <h3>Kidney damage</h3>
        <p>
          Water helps dissolve minerals and nutrients, making them more
          accessible to the body. It also helps remove waste products. These two
          functions make water vital to the kidneys. Every day, the kidneys
          filter around 110-140 liters of fluid. Of these, approximately 1-2
          liters are removed from the body in the form of urine, and the rest is
          recovered by the bloodstream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water is essential for the kidneys to function. If the kidneys do not
          function properly, waste products and excess fluid can build up inside
          the body. Untreated, chronic kidney disease can lead to kidney
          failure. The organs stop working, and either dialysis or kidney
          transplantation is required. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the
          second most common type of infection in the body. They account for
          around 8.1 million visits to health care providers in the U.S. every
          year. If infections spread to the upper urinary tract, including the
          kidneys, permanent damage can result. Sudden, or acute, kidney
          infections can be life-threatening, particularly if septicemia occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drinking plenty of water is a simple way to reduce the risk of
          developing a UTI and to help treat an existing UTI. Kidney stones
          interfere with how the kidneys work. When present, can complicate
          UTIs. These complicated UTIs tend to require longer periods of
          antibiotics to treat them, typically lasting 7 to 14 days. The leading
          cause of kidney stones is a lack of water. People who report them
          often do not drink the recommended daily amount of water. Kidney
          stones may also increase the risk of chronic kidney disease. In
          November 2014, the American College of Physicians issued new
          guidelines for people who have previously developed kidney stones. The
          guidelines state that increasing fluid intake to enable 2 liters of
          urination a day could decrease the risk of stone recurrence by at
          least half with no side effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dehydration happens if we use and lose more water than the body takes
          in. It can lead to an imbalance in the body’s electrolytes.
          Electrolytes, such as potassium, phosphate, and sodium, help carry
          electrical signals between cells. The kidneys keep the levels of
          electrolytes in the body stable when they function properly. When the
          kidneys are unable to maintain a balance in the levels of
          electrolytes, these electrical signals become mixed up. This can lead
          to seizures, involving involuntary muscle movements and loss of
          consciousness. In severe cases, dehydration can lead to kidney
          failure, which can be life-threatening. Possible complications of
          chronic kidney failure include anemia, damage to the central nervous
          system, heart failure, and a compromised immune system.

        <h3>Water sources</h3>
        <p>
          Some of the water required by the body is obtained through foods with
          a high water content, such as soups, tomatoes, oranges, but most come
          through drinking water and other beverages.
        </p>
        <p>
          During everyday functioning, water is lost by the body, and this needs
          to be replaced. We notice that we lose water through activities such
          as sweating and urination, but water is lost even when breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drinking water, whether from the tap or a bottle, is the best source
          of fluid for the body. Milk and juices are also good sources of fluid,
          but beverages containing alcohol and caffeine, such as soft drinks,
          coffee, and beer, are not ideal because they often contain empty
          calories. Drinking water instead of soda can help with weight loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was previously thought that caffeinated beverages had diuretic
          properties, meaning that they cause the body to release water.
          However, studies show that fluid loss because of caffeinated drinks is
          minimal.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="water-intake">
        <h3>Recommended water intake</h3>
        <p>
          The amount of water needed each day varies from person to person,
          depending on how active they are, how much they sweat, and so on.
          There is no fixed amount of water that must be consumed daily, but
          there is general agreement on what a healthy fluid intake is.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
          Medicine, the average recommended daily intake of water from both food
          and drink is:
          <ul>
            <li>For men: around 3.7 liters;</li>
            <li>For women: around 2.7 liters.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This would be around 15.5 cups for men and just over 11 cups for
          women. However, around 80 percent of this should come from drinks,
          including water, and the rest will be from food. This means that:
          <ul>
            <li>Men should drink around 12.5 cups of fluid;</li>
            <li>Women should drink around 9 cups.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Fresh fruits and vegetables and all non-alcoholic fluids count towards
          this recommendation. Times when it is most important to drink plenty
          of water include:
          <ul>
            <li>when you have a fever;</li>
            <li>when the weather is hot;</li>
            <li>if you have diarrhea/vomiting;</li>
            <li>
              when you sweat a lot, for example, due to physical activity.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
